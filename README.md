# TalentSage SQA Automation Assignment — Candidate CV Upload

## Overview
This repository contains basic UI and API automation tests for Candidate CV Upload using Playwright.

## Why these tests were automated
- CV upload is a critical candidate workflow
- Ensures AI evaluation can start on uploaded documents
- High business risk if uploads fail or data leaks occur

## What would be automated next
- AI resume evaluation validation
- Multi-tenant access: candidates see only their own data
- Role-based restrictions for recruiter vs candidate

## What should remain manual
- Validation of AI scoring & biases
- File content verification for sensitive info
- UX testing of candidate portal
